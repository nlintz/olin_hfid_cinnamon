					<h2>Usability Study Protocol</h2>
					<br>
					<p><strong>Background Context:</strong></p>
					<p>
						Our users have requested a confirmation when the registration process is complete. Our original website had no submission of a course list or confirmation when the user was “finished” registering. This is represented in Case C (a control). We have added two types of submit buttons to provide confirmation for our users. Case B is to show users a simple message upon pressing the “submit” button that the registration process will be automatically completed according to their chosen preferences and that the user can always change his or her course priority list before the due date. Case A shows users a list of courses containing the most plausible schedule of the upcoming semester. The message about automatic registration is also provided.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Case A is providing more information as compared to Case B. While this increases the visibility of the system state and boosts the confidence of our users, we are concerned that too much information ultimately may not lead to satisfaction. For example, the actual message that “registration is complete” may be hard to find due to the large amount of information. This will increase the time that users stay on the interface, which we expect to leave users frustrated and dissatisfied. We would like to see if this concern of user dissatisfaction is negligible compared to the confidence gained from additional information.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p><strong>Hypothesis:</strong></p>
					<p>
						We expect that the existence of a submit button (Case B below) will provide a more satisfying experience for the user than no submit button (Case C below). Furthermore, we expect the user’s confidence in the system to increase with the existence of the submit button. We expect that providing more information when the submit button is clicked (Case A below) will lead to increased confidence in the system but decreased satisfaction as compared to Case B due to the increase in time necessary for completion.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p><strong>Ideal Testing Conditions:</strong></p>
					<p>
						We would take our user base, then randomly distribute them into three subgroups of users. We would present each subgroup with one of our interfaces (A, B, or C), which they would individually complete. We would watch each person register and ask the questions outlined above.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p><strong>Independent Variables:</strong></p>
					<p>
						The only factor that we will vary is the type of confirmation message that the user receives when he or she is finished registering.
					</p>
					<p>
						There are three cases will be tested:
						<ul>
							<li>A- submit button that shows a popup course list</li>
							<li>B- submit button that shows simple confirmation message</li>
							<li>C- no submit button (control)</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>
						Case A provides the largest amount of information, while Case C, the control, provides the least amount of information.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p><strong>Dependent Variables:</strong></p>
					<p>
						There are three dependant variables:
						<ol>
							<li>Time spent confirming</li>
							<li>Satisfaction with interface</li>
							<li>Satisfaction with interface</li>
						</ol>
					</p>
					<p>
						The amount of information in the message is measured by the time the user spends confirming the courses selected.Time will be measured unbeknownst the testers, from when the tester finished making the list of courses to when the tester says that he/she says the registration is complete.
					</p>
					<p>
						Then the tester will be asked to rank the satisfaction and confidence with the interface on a scale of 1 - 3 (where 1 is least satisfied and 3 is most satisfied) using the following questions:
						<ul>
							<li>How satisfied are you with the system?</li>
							<li>How confident are you that the system will represent your best interests?</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>
						Tester will be asked a final open-ended question about his or her emotions throughout the registration process.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p><strong>If our hypothesis is correct, what pattern would you expect to observe in the response variables?</strong></p>
					<p>
						We expect people testing the interface without a “submit” button to be confused when they are “finished registering” since there is no indication that the user has completed the registration process. We think that if provided with a submit button for closure and validation at the end of registration, users will feel more comfortable with their automatic registration later (since they know they have provided all of the information that the system needs). We think that a list of courses will provide helpful information to some users but will take more time to read and understand than what the user wants.  Therefore, we expect the time spent confirming to go from no time (no submit button, Case C) to little time (pressing the submit button and getting a text confirmation, Case B) to a significant amount of time (using the popup course list to see the possible schedule, Case A). We expect confidence to be maximized with the popup course list (Case A) and satisfaction to be maximized with the submit button with a text confirmation (Case B).

					<h2>Design Changes</h2>
					<br>
					<p>Through the heuristic evaluation, we received feedback about the usability of our website. In this section, we have outlined a summary of the problems contained in that document and provided the solutions we implemented to resolve these issues.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>No feedback or closure after courses are submitted for registration</li>
						<ul>
							<li>We are in the process of running a Usability Study to determine how much closure and confirmation our users want after choosing courses.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>No way to leave/log out of the system</li>
						<ul>
							<li>A log out button was added in the upper right-hand corner of the window.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>No error messages when courses conflict, and course conflicts are not extremely visible</li>
						<ul>
							<li>If two courses in the schedule conflict, an error message appears in a red shaded box above the calendar to make this visible to the user.</li>
